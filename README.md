# 🔐 Quantum-Secure Federated Fraud Detection for Retail  
*A privacy-preserving, real-time fraud detection platform for retailers — powered by federated learning and quantum-resistant encryption.*

---

## 🧠 Overview

In the age of digital commerce, retailers are under constant threat from fraud, bots, and identity theft. Traditional centralized fraud detection systems require sharing sensitive data, risking compliance violations and customer trust.

This project introduces a **federated, privacy-first approach** that allows retailers to collaboratively detect fraud **without sharing customer data** — and it’s protected by **quantum-safe encryption** for long-term security.

---

## 💡 Core Concept

We combine two cutting-edge technologies:

1. **Federated Learning** – Enables multiple retailers to train a shared AI fraud detection model **without sharing raw data**.
2. **Post-Quantum Encryption** – Secures all model updates using encryption that’s resistant to future quantum computer attacks.

Together, they create a powerful, privacy-preserving, and future-ready fraud prevention system.

## 🔧 How It Works

### 🔁 Global Model = **Base Knowledge**
- Hosted centrally.
- Built by securely aggregating encrypted model updates from all participating retailers.
- Contains **no raw data** — only learnings distilled from local models.

### 🧠 Local Model = **Base Knowledge + Real-Time Experience**
- Deployed within each retailer's infrastructure.
- Initializes with the latest **global model weights**.
- Continuously:
  - Trains on local real-time transaction data.
  - Detects fraud live (coupon abuse, payment anomalies, bot-like activity).
  - Sends encrypted model updates (weights/gradients) back to the central aggregator.

## 📦 Key Features

### ✅ Real-Time Fraud Detection
- Local models continuously score incoming transactions.
- Flags high-risk activity instantly using pre-trained AI models.
- Can block, hold, or require extra verification on the spot.

### ✅ Privacy by Design
- **No raw data ever leaves** the retailer's system.
- Only model updates (not user logs) are shared.
- Updates are encrypted before transmission using **CRYSTALS-Kyber** or similar post-quantum methods.

### ✅ Federated Intelligence
- Each retailer benefits from **global fraud detection knowledge**, contributed by others in the network.
- Faster detection of new attack patterns across regions and sectors.

### ✅ Quantum-Resistant Encryption
- All model updates are secured using **lattice-based cryptography** (Kyber, Dilithium).
- Future-proof against threats from quantum computing.

### ✅ Continuous Model Sync
- Retailers receive regular updates of the improved global model.
- Local models combine it with fresh, real-time local data — ensuring relevance and adaptability.

## 📊 Example Use Case: Flipkart + Walmart

- Flipkart connects their MongoDB; Walmart connects MySQL.
- Both see real-time transactions scored and flagged by their local models.
- Local training happens automatically as new behavior is observed.
- Periodically, encrypted updates are sent to the aggregator.
- Global model is updated and pushed back to all participants.
- Result: Faster, smarter fraud detection across both ecosystems — **with zero compromise on data privacy.**
