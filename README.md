# 🔐 Secure Federated Fraud Detection for Retail  
*A privacy-preserving, real-time fraud detection platform for retailers — powered by federated learning and encrypted model sharing.*

---

## 🧠 Overview

Retailers face constant threats from fraud, bot attacks, and identity misuse. But traditional fraud detection methods require centralized data sharing, which introduces risks of data leaks and compliance violations.

This project introduces a **federated, privacy-first approach** that allows retailers to collaboratively detect fraud **without sharing customer data** — using encrypted model updates and a lightweight coordination backend.

---

## 💡 Core Concept

We combine two key technologies:

1. **Federated Learning** – Allows multiple retailers to train a shared AI fraud detection model **without exchanging raw data**.
2. **Encrypted Model Transfer** – All model updates are encrypted before leaving a client, ensuring data minimization and secure collaboration.

Together, this creates a robust, privacy-respecting and scalable fraud detection framework.

## 🔧 How It Works

### 🔁 Global Model = **Base Knowledge**
- Aggregated on the backend.
- Built by combining encrypted model updates from all participating clients.
- Stored in a lightweight backend database (PocketBase).
- **No raw transactional data is ever collected centrally.**

### 🧠 Local Model = **Base Knowledge + Real-Time Intelligence**
- Runs inside each retailer’s secure infrastructure.
- Starts from the latest global model snapshot.
- Continuously:
  - Trains on local real-time transaction data.
  - Detects fraud live (e.g., coupon abuse, payment anomalies, bot-like behavior).
  - Sends encrypted model updates (weights or gradients) to the central backend for aggregation.

## 📦 Key Features

### ✅ Real-Time Fraud Detection
- Local models continuously score incoming transactions.
- Flags high-risk activity instantly using locally trained AI models.
- Supports real-time decisioning (block, hold, escalate).

### ✅ Privacy by Design
- **No raw data ever leaves** a client’s infrastructure.
- Only encrypted model updates are transmitted.
- Local training happens entirely offline.

### ✅ Federated Intelligence
- Clients benefit from **shared learnings** contributed by others in the network.
- Enables faster adaptation to new fraud trends across industries.

### ✅ Encrypted Model Exchange
- All updates (weights) are encrypted before upload.
- Models are stored securely and updated incrementally.
- No individual client’s private model is ever exposed.

### ✅ Lightweight Coordination
- Uses **PocketBase** (embedded Go-based backend) to:
  - Track uploads
  - Distribute global model updates
  - Maintain metadata (clients, training status, timestamps)

## 📊 Example Use Case: Flipkart + Walmart

- Flipkart connects their transaction data stream.
- Walmart connects theirs separately.
- Both run real-time local models, detecting fraud before checkout.
- Local model updates are encrypted and sent to the backend.
- Backend updates the global model and syncs it to all clients.
- Result: smarter fraud detection for both — with **no privacy compromise**.
